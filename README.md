The project title "Realtime Weather and Country facts"
Project is using two API's to gather information regarding country facts and current weather conditions.
The application pulls current data from restcountries.com API and weatherapi.com. 
Information from restcountries.com has a hyperlink to wikipedia identifying key facts to link to the wikipedia page that includes the information. 
The restcountries.com api also includes googlemaps links to the country which is also included in the app.
The weatherapi.com API pulls current weather information for the capital city of the country searched on.
There is also a history of searched countries that allows the user to search a previously searched country again using local storage.
The technologies of code used was javascript, CSS, and html. 
Challenges faced were learning to use API data and determine if objects were separate or in an array. API data format is not standardized and many API's use different formats to send data.
Running the program only requires a web browser.
